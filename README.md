A reminder of: 1) The values we provide functions are called ARGUMENTS.
2)The first argument, from: 0 is the starting number of the sequence (0).
3)The second argument, to: 6 is the end of the sequence (6). But notice, we didn’t print out 6 which means this end number is not included.
4)The third argument, by: 2 determines how much to increment (or decrement if we use a negative number) during each iteration. Here’s how the value of num changes in the loop
